# ECORE: Recycling Mod

ECORE is a planned set of mods which overhauls the experience of the survival game, Eco.

This mod is one of many, pre-released (with warnings!) for those interested. It includes disassembly recipes added to the Tool Table for most stone objects/items.

Please take note;
- This is an alpha version. Don't use it.
- If you must use it, only do so if you know what you're doing and can edit the C# code yourself.
- There's a loophole which allows players to make free tool repairs, so consider unincluding those recipes for now.

## Features
- todo

## Planned
- Automatic recycling recipe discovery
- Fixed repair limits on vanilla tools - forcing people to discard tools/workbenches eventually
- Recipes/items other than 'existing' ones
- Other features and details
- Custom 3D object / toolbench
- Maybe specialisation. Maybe...

## Contributions
I welcome contributions - please open a pull request and I'll merge it in if appropriate.

## Installation

Please don't install this, it's not ready. If you must, though... for Eco 9.4.1, place this in a folder (name is up to you) in Mods/UserCode, on the Server. That's it.
