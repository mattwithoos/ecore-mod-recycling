# ECORE: Recycling Mod

This mod returns one third of an item's construction cost. As the game doesn't store what type of material was used in construction (e.g. Redwood Log vs Fir Log for a stockpile, or Granite vs Sandstone for a Stone Tool), I've gone with what I felt was the lowest common denominator - e.g. always return granite. Currently supports most wood & stone tools/objects.

ECORE is a planned set of mods which overhauls the experience of the survival game, Eco.

This mod is one of many, pre-released (with warnings!) for those interested. It includes disassembly recipes added to the Tool Table for most stone objects/items.

Please take note;
- This is an alpha version. Don't use it.
- If you must use it, only do so if you know what you're doing and can edit the C# code yourself.
- There's a loophole which allows players to make free tool repairs, so consider unincluding those recipes for now.

## Features
- todo

## Planned
- Automatic recycling recipe discovery
- Fixed repair limits on vanilla tools - forcing people to discard tools/workbenches eventually
- Recipes/items other than 'existing' ones
- Other features and details
- Custom 3D object / toolbench
- Maybe specialisation. Maybe...

## Installation

Please don't install this, it's not ready. If you must, though... for Eco 9.4.1, place this in a folder (name is up to you) in Mods/UserCode, on the Server. That's it.
